# TheDiary
A Diary Java Applicaiton
It a simple Diary Application for the desktop users. It allows the users to create the multiple credentials to login in the applicaiton.
The Diary application allows the users to write their daily thoughts in an interface that simulates a real paper diary.
The diary is displayed day by day. There is a calendar that allows the users to go to a specific day.
There are still a lot of things to be improved. I would like to receive your valuable comments on this diary applicaiton.
